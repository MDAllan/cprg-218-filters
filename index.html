                <h3>The waves</h3>
                <p>The Waves (2022) - A blend of motion and fluidity. This painting represents the changing nature of the ocean. The interplay of the moonlight and silhouettes creates a soft scene where the shadow moves gently in the night. This art piece symbolizes resilience and power through the unstoppable force of the ocean, no matter how hard the waves are, the boat remains strong and steady against the tide.

                <h3>The Dark Starry Night</h3>
                <p>The  Darker Starry Night (2021) - Inspired by Van Goghâ€™s Starry Night (1889). Starry night represents a  city view from Van Goghâ€™s window. This version takes a darker, and more mysterious approach compared to the original version. The deep blue and black represent the passage of time and how perspectives change over the years. In my reflection, the yellow stars represent the uniqueness of each person shining bright in the dark sky. </p>

                <h3>The Reflection</h3>
                <p>The Reflection (2019) - This painting captures a peaceful and quiet moment. I created this art piece after a summer trip to Lake Louise so it turned out similar to the view I had in my head. This piece focuses on the stillness of water mirroring the sky and the trees. The gentle colors and soft blending makes it feel calming. Itâ€™s a reminder of how nature mirrors our emotions, reflecting both our inner calm and the beauty that surrounds us.

                <h3>Black Panther</h3>
                <p>Black Panther (2020) - This drawing symbolizes strength and resilience. The contrast of the white charcoal on the black background enhances the representation of the art piece. The glowing, green eyes represent a sense of guidance and anticipation showing the viewer that no matter how many obstacles we have in our lives, we should always have hope and believe in ourselves.</p>

                <h3>Arabian Calligraphy</h3>
                <p>Arabian Calligraphy (2024) - Arabic calligraphy is not just about words; itâ€™s a form of art. This piece is created with indian black ink and water paint. It is immensely important to me, as it was a great opportunity for me to reconnect with my native language after a long time. This art piece showcases the famous verse, "Be patient, you are in our eyes," referring to how God watches over us and cares for us, leaving us with reassurance and patience.

                <h3>Death Note Portrait</h3>
                <p>Death Note portrait (2022) - Inspired by my favorite anime, Death Note. This piece features a split portrait, half of Light Yagamiâ€™s face, and half of Lâ€™s face. A mix of art techniques are used to create a dramatic effect of the Art piece. The Death Note book was created as a three-dimensional piece and attached to the artwork. The blend of light and shadow adds to the mystery, reflecting the themes of justice, power, and the battle between Light and L.
